## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I optimized the algorithm of number recognition, trying to avoid the confusion caused by human error. 
Plus I am still learning web crawlar.  

## This Week's Plan

Since the upcoming week will be a test week, I will not spend much time on the project. But I will still working on the web crawlar. 

## Anything Blocking?

The web crawlar is totally a new thing to me, so I probably need more time to learn about it.
